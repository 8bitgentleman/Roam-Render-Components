- ### Namespace Page List <a name = "namespace"></a>
  This component will create a dynamic list of all pages within a certain namespace (`roam` for example would include `roam/js`, `roam/css`, etc ). This can be useful to see a dynamic list of all Projects, Books, People, etc. To use simply trigger the included template ( `;;`) and pass your desired namespace into the component as an argument

- ### WIP Highlight Review <a name = "highlight"></a>
  This is a WIP component which creates a custom UI where highlights/quotes in your graph can be reviewed. For this extension to work highlights must be nested under a specific tag/page/attribute quotes.  It's currently extremely picky about the format and metadata that your pages have. I've included my personal template but any block nested under #quotes should be seen by the component.

- ### WIP Roam to Orbit <a name = "orbit"></a>
  THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND NOT READY FOR GENERAL USAGE
  
  This is a component that will integrate with <a href='https://github.com/andymatuschak/orbit'>Andy Matuschak's</a> new open-source experimental spaced repetition  platform <a href='https://github.com/andymatuschak/orbit'>Orbit.</a>
  You will pass a page name string into the component and it will load all prompts and answers that reference that page. You can find the code and optional CSS <a href="https://github.com/8bitgentleman/Roam-Render-Components/raw/main/Roam%20to%20Orbit">here</a>.

- ### WIP Roam Stopwatch <a name = "stopwatch"></a>
  THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND NOT READY FOR GENERAL USAGE
  
  This is a component that acts as a stopwatch, counting up instead of counting down (like POMO). When clicking the button the current lap length will be added as a child block and the lap will reset. To set a custom title pass in a string in quotes to the componenet. See the code and optional CSS <a href="https://github.com/8bitgentleman/Roam-Render-Components/raw/main/Roam%20Stopwatch">here</a>.
